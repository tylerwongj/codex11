# Advanced Unity Topics Learning Guide

These modules expand on the core Unity skills with systems-focused practices for scaling projects. Work through each topic as a learning sprint, combining study, hands-on experiments, and documentation.

- [ScriptableObject Architecture, Event Channels, and Data-Driven Design](scriptableobject-architecture.md)
- [Addressables, Asset Bundles, and Resource Management](addressables-asset-bundles.md)
- [Profiling, Performance Optimization, Memory Usage, and Frame Budget](profiling-performance-optimization.md)
- [Custom Inspectors, Editor Scripting, and Tooling Workflows](custom-inspectors-editor-scripting.md)
- [Building for Platforms, Player Settings, Build Pipeline, and CI Basics](build-pipeline-ci-basics.md)

Use retrospectives after each module to capture lessons learned and follow-up tasks.
