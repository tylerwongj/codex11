# Custom Inspectors, Editor Scripting, and Tooling Workflows
- **Inspector customization:** Build property drawers and editor windows that reduce repetitive setup. Example: a `ReorderableList` for enemy spawn waves.
- **Editor automation:** Script menu commands for scene validation, linting, or asset migration. Integrate with `AssetPostprocessor` to enforce naming conventions or compression settings.
- **UI Toolkit vs. IMGUI:** Prototype the same tool in both systems to understand retained-mode vs. immediate-mode trade-offs.
- **Testing editor tools:** Add editor integration tests (`UnityEditor.TestTools`) to prevent regressions when Unity upgrades.
- **Versioning:** Package reusable tools into UPM packages (inside `Packages/`) and document install steps in `docs/10-tooling-workflow/`.
- **Exercises:** Create a custom inspector for a data-driven ability system that highlights missing assets and provides quick links to related ScriptableObjects.

## Custom Inspector Sample
```csharp
[CustomEditor(typeof(HealthComponent))]
public class HealthComponentEditor : Editor
{
    public override void OnInspectorGUI()
    {
        DrawDefaultInspector();
        if (GUILayout.Button("Debug Heal"))
        {
            ((HealthComponent)target).Heal(10);
        }
    }
}
```
