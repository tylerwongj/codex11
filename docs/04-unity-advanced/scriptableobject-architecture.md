# ScriptableObject Architecture, Event Channels, and Data-Driven Design
- **Data as assets:** Organize gameplay configuration (stats, loot tables, dialogue) into `ScriptableObject` assets. Prototype a feature where designers tweak balance without code changes.
- **Event channel pattern:** Implement broadcast-only ScriptableObjects that wrap `UnityEvent` or custom delegates. Replace direct scene references with these channels to decouple publishers and listeners.
- **Runtime cloning:** Explore when to duplicate ScriptableObject data at runtime (e.g., per-player inventory) versus keeping shared immutable data.
- **Dependency injection:** Combine ScriptableObjects with `Context` prefabs or frameworks like Zenject to wire dependencies. Document trade-offs between ScriptableObject singletons and DI containers.
- **Exercises:** Refactor an existing MonoBehaviour-heavy system (e.g., quest management) into ScriptableObject-driven architecture with unit tests covering asset loading edge cases.

## ScriptableObject Channel
```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Events/HealthChanged")]
public class HealthChangedChannel : ScriptableObject
{
    public UnityAction<int> OnRaised;

    public void Raise(int currentHealth) => OnRaised?.Invoke(currentHealth);
}
```

## Key Terms
- **ScriptableObject**: Asset-based data container that lets designers tweak values without scene dependencies.
- **Event Channel**: ScriptableObject that broadcasts events to decoupled listeners via delegates or UnityEvents.
- **Runtime Clone**: Copy of a ScriptableObject created at runtime when per-player state must diverge from shared data.
- **Dependency Injection**: Technique for supplying references via contexts or frameworks like Zenject instead of singletons.
- **Data-Driven Design**: Architecture where gameplay behaviour reads from assets/configs rather than hard-coded values.
