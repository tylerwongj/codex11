# Learning Library Overview

Use this index to navigate the reorganized curriculum. Work through the onboarding track first, then
chip away at the Unity modules while pulling reference and team playbooks as needed.

## Onboarding Track
- [C# Learning Hub](00-csharp/README.md): refresh core language skills before diving into Unity.
- [Unity Learning Roadmaps](01-unity-roadmaps/README.md): choose the study path that fits your goals.

## Unity Curriculum
- [Unity Core Concepts](02-unity-core/README.md): master scenes, prefabs, and project layout fundamentals.
- [Unity Gameplay Systems](03-unity-gameplay/README.md): design production-ready gameplay loops and systems.
- [Advanced Unity Topics](04-unity-advanced/README.md): scale projects with architecture and tooling upgrades.
- [Unity Supplementary Topics](05-unity-supplementary/README.md): explore specialty modules to round out skills.
- [Unity Testing & Quality](06-unity-testing-quality/README.md): strengthen validation, QA, and release practices.

## C# Mastery
- [Modern C# Features](07-modern-csharp/README.md): level up with language improvements used in Unity work.

## Reference Library
- [Game Programming Patterns](08-game-programming-patterns/README.md): study reusable gameplay architectures.
- [Math & Simulation](09-math-simulation/README.md): reinforce the math that powers physics, AI, and systems.

## Team Operations
- [Tooling & Workflow](10-tooling-workflow/README.md): streamline developer environments and pipelines.
- [Meta Documentation](11-meta/README.md): keep shared guidelines, policies, and process notes in sync.
