# Unity Core Concepts Learning Guide

This guide covers the fundamentals you should master before building production-grade projects in Unity.
Each module below links to a focused topic so you can tackle one concept at a time.

- [Unity Project Layout, Scenes, Prefabs, and Build Targets](project-layout-scenes-prefabs-build-targets.md)
- [MonoBehaviour Lifecycle and Script Execution Order](monobehaviour-lifecycle-execution-order.md)
- [GameObjects, Transforms, Components, Prefab Variants, and Script References](gameobjects-transforms-components.md)
- [Serialization Rules in Unity](unity-serialization-rules.md)
- [Scene Management (SceneManager, Additive Loading, Persistent Managers)](scene-management.md)

Work through the modules in order, pairing each with a small in-editor experiment to solidify the ideas.
