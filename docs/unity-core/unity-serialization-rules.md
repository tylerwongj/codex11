# Serialization Rules in Unity
- **Serialized fields:** Public fields and private fields marked with `[SerializeField]` persist in scenes and prefabs. Avoid serializing types Unity cannot handle (e.g., raw dictionaries without helper classes).
- **Supported types:** Review which built-in types serialize by default (primitive types, `Vector3`, `Color`, `AnimationCurve`). For custom classes, annotate with `[System.Serializable]`.
- **ScriptableObjects:** Create data assets for configuration (e.g., weapon stats). Learn how to create instances from the Assets menu and reference them from MonoBehaviours.
- **Serialization pitfalls:** Understand that references break when scripts move namespaces, that serialized data updates only when values change in the inspector, and that polymorphic fields require `[SerializeReference]` and custom drawers.
- **Version control considerations:** Track `.meta` files to preserve GUIDs. Use `Force Text` serialization in editor settings for diff-friendly YAML assets.
- **Practice exercise:** Build a `ScriptableObject` for game difficulty settings, expose it in a manager MonoBehaviour, and observe how changes propagate across scenes.
