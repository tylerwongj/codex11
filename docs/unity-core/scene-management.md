# Scene Management (SceneManager, Additive Loading, Persistent Managers)
- **SceneManager API:** Call `SceneManager.LoadScene` and `SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync` to transition scenes. Understand synchronous vs. asynchronous loading trade-offs for UX and hitching.
- **Additive workflows:** Use additive loading to compose levels from smaller chunks. Load a base scene containing global lighting and audio, then add gameplay sections on demand.
- **Persistent managers:** Create a `Bootstrap` scene with systems like audio, input, and save-game managers. Use `DontDestroyOnLoad` judiciously to keep singleton objects alive between scene changes.
- **Scene activation:** Separate loading from activation to pre-load heavy assets. Call `allowSceneActivation = false` during async operations when you want a loading screen.
- **Unloading scenes:** Use `SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync` to free memory. Confirm that persistent objects do not reference destroyed scene objects to avoid `MissingReferenceException`.
- **Testing checklist:** Script editor tools to launch additive scene sets, and build automated play-mode tests that verify essential managers exist after scene transitions.
