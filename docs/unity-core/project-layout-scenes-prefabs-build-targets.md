# Unity Project Layout, Scenes, Prefabs, and Build Targets
- **Project anatomy:** Understand the role of the `Assets`, `Packages`, `ProjectSettings`, and `Library` folders. Practice navigating them in the editor and in a file explorer.
- **Scenes:** Learn how `.unity` scene files capture object hierarchies. Create a gameplay scene, a UI overlay scene, and experiment with scene-specific lighting settings.
- **Prefabs and prefab variants:** Build reusable GameObjects (e.g., a pickup item). Convert them into prefabs, then create variants to override select properties such as materials or behavior flags.
- **Asset pipelines:** Import common asset types (models, textures, audio). Note how Unity creates meta files and how import settings affect runtime performance.
- **Build targets:** Switch between PC/Mac/Linux and mobile build targets. Record which assets need platform-specific configuration (compression, shader variants, input handling).
- **Hands-on checkpoint:** Organize a demo project with separate folders for art, code, and prefabs. Use a naming convention like `Scenes/Gameplay`, `Prefabs/UI`, and `Scripts/Controllers`.
