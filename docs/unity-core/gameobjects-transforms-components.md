# GameObjects, Transforms, Components, Prefab Variants, and Script References
- **GameObjects:** Treat them as containers; every gameplay entity is composed of multiple components.
- **Transforms:** Manipulate position, rotation, and scale. Practice both local (`transform.localPosition`) and world (`transform.position`) space adjustments.
- **Component-based design:** Compose behavior by attaching scripts, renderers, colliders, and audio components. Use `GetComponent`, `GetComponentInChildren`, and cached references to manage performance.
- **Prefab variants:** Demonstrate inheritance-like behavior by creating variants for enemies with shared base stats but customized visuals or abilities.
- **Script references:** Assign references either via inspector drag-and-drop, `SerializeField`, or runtime discovery. Compare the cost and reliability of each approach.
- **Hierarchy best practices:** Group related objects under empty GameObjects (e.g., `Enemies`, `Interactables`). Reset transforms on parent containers to avoid unwanted offsets.
