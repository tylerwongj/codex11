# Vector Math Fundamentals
- Master vector operations: addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication.
- Deep-dive dot and cross products; analyze geometric interpretations and practical use cases.
- Practice vector normalization and projection with numerical stability considerations.
- Explore quaternion algebra, conversions to/from Euler angles, and understand gimbal lock pitfalls.
- Exercises: derive view-direction vectors, implement quaternion-based rotations, and debug Euler edge cases in small scripts.
- Resources: *3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development* (Dunn/Parberry), Freya Holmer's vector math video series, and the *Quaternion Calculus for Animation* SIGGRAPH course notes.

## Vector Projection Example
```csharp
var projection = Vector3.Project(oncomingVelocity, laneDirection);
```
