# Math & Simulation Learning Path

Progress through these math-focused modules to support gameplay systems, physics, and procedural content.

- [Vector Math Fundamentals](vector-math-fundamentals.md)
- [Coordinate Systems & Transformations](coordinate-systems-transformations.md)
- [Kinematics & Interpolation](kinematics-interpolation.md)
- [Randomness & Procedural Generation](randomness-procedural-generation.md)
- [Spatial Partitioning & Optimization](spatial-partitioning-optimization.md)

After each module, capture takeaways in code experiments and update shared documentation. See the integration strategy below to plan your study cadence.

## Integration Strategy
- Sequence modules progressively: vectors → transforms → kinematics → randomness → partitioning.
- Allocate weekly sprints combining study, implementation, and demo review with peers or mentors.
- Maintain a sandbox repository for experiment scripts; document findings in `docs/` for future reference.
- Regularly revisit earlier topics through capstone mini-projects, such as a physics-driven camera, procedural dungeon generator, or spatially optimized AI crowd demo.

## Math Topics
```bash
ls docs/09-math-simulation
```
