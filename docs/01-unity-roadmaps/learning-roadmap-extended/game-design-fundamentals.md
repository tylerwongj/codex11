# Game Design Fundamentals

## Timeline
- Sprint 1 (Weeks 1–2): Research loop theory and player motivation models; summarize key takeaways.
- Sprint 2 (Weeks 3–4): Apply frameworks to current milestone, draft personas, and map loops.
- Ongoing: Reserve a two-hour block weekly for playtest review and design iteration.

## Suggested Resources
- Books: "The Art of Game Design" by Jesse Schell, "Rules of Play" by Salen & Zimmerman.
- Talks: GDC sessions on progression, retention, and player psychology (e.g., Celia Hodent, Raph Koster).
- Articles/Videos: Extra Credits loops series, MDA/Bartle breakdowns, Game UX Summit recaps.
- Tools: Miro or FigJam for loop diagrams, Airtable/Sheets for balancing scenarios.

## Deliverables
- Loop diagram pack (core/secondary/meta) with annotations on player emotion targets.
- Player persona sheets referencing demographics, motivations, and UX considerations.
- Balance model spreadsheets tracking XP curves, economy sinks/sources, and difficulty ramps.
- Playtest report template capturing hypotheses, observations, and actionable follow-ups.

## Tracking & Reflection
- Maintain a versioned design journal (Notion/Obsidian) with dated entries and tags (e.g., #loops, #psychology).
- Log playtest participants, scenarios, and outcomes for continuity between sessions.
- Conduct mini-retros after each iteration to capture design debts or research needs.
- Sync design insights with engineering backlog so feature work stays aligned.

Secondary Loop -> Daily challenges -> Reward chest -> Shop refresh
Meta Loop -> Weekly questline -> Narrative beat -> Cosmetic drop

## Key Terms
- **Core Loop**: Primary gameplay cycle that drives engagement and repeat play.
- **Secondary Loop**: Supporting loop (daily challenges, sidequests) that complements the core loop.
- **Meta Loop**: Long-term progression cycle such as weekly questlines or cosmetic rewards.
- **Player Persona**: Document describing archetypal players—their motivations, goals, and constraints.
- **Balance Model**: Spreadsheet or simulation that tracks numbers like XP curves and economy sinks/sources.
- **Playtest Report**: Template capturing hypotheses, observations, and action items from testing sessions.
- **Design Journal**: Versioned log of design decisions, research notes, and revisions.
- **Loop Diagram**: Visual map showing how actions feed into rewards and new goals.
