# Curated Learning Resources

## Timeline
- Start of month: Audit existing list, remove outdated links, and add new priorities aligned to active milestones.
- Weekly: Consume at least one resource per active module and summarize learnings.
- Quarterly: Deep clean the knowledge base, tagging resources by impact and difficulty.

## Suggested Resources
- Unity Learn: Mission-based pathways (Junior Programmer, Creator Kits) and relevant microgames.
- Conferences/Talks: GDC Vault playlists, Unite sessions, Nordic Game and Game UX Summit archives.
- Newsletters/Communities: Game Dev Digest, Unity Blogs, r/Unity3D highlights, professional Discord servers.
- Sample Repos: Official Unity samples, Open Project, community-maintained toolkits (e.g., Odin Inspector examples).

## Deliverables
- Resource index spreadsheet or database with tags, time investment, and relevance score.
- Annotated summaries capturing key insights, questions, and action items.
- Skill map linking roadmap modules to the resources that unlocked each competency.
- Backlog of future reads/watch items prioritized by upcoming milestones.

## Tracking & Reflection
- Use knowledge management tools (Notion, Obsidian, Dendron) to version notes and track completion dates.
- Apply spaced-repetition or review cadences to revisit high-value content.
- Share monthly highlights with peers/mentors to reinforce learning and gather recommendations.
- Monitor gaps (e.g., networking, shaders) and schedule dedicated discovery sprints.
