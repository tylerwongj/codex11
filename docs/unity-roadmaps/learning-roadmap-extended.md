# Unity Learning Roadmap – Extended Ideas

## Milestone Projects
- Timeline: Schedule a 4–6 week cadence per project with a one-week spike, three-week build, and polish/postmortem buffer.
- Resources: Unity Learn microgames, Brackeys prototypes, GameMaker's Toolkit design breakdowns, project templates from community repos.
- Deliverables: Playable build, design changelog, postmortem doc, reusable systems/package list ready for future reuse.
- Tracking: Kanban board with scope labels, weekly burndown, and retro notes tied to Git commits or tasks.

## Game Design Fundamentals
- Timeline: Dedicate a 2-week research sprint followed by ongoing weekly review sessions while shipping milestones.
- Resources: "The Art of Game Design" decks, GDC Vault talks on loops/psychology, Extra Credits playlists, MDA/Bartle summaries.
- Deliverables: Loop diagrams, player persona sheets, balance spreadsheets, and documented playtest reports.
- Tracking: Maintain a living design journal with versioned updates and tag references for implemented insights.

## Art and Audio Pipeline Essentials
- Timeline: Parallel 3-week pipeline setup alongside active milestone; reserve weekly syncs with art/audio collaborators.
- Resources: Unity manual import guides, Audio Mixer documentation, Stylized Station or 80 Level workflow posts, FMOD/Wwise tutorials.
- Deliverables: Pipeline checklist, asset naming convention doc, Unity preset collection, audio routing/mixer template.
- Tracking: Automate CI validation and maintain asset review logs in version control.

## Advanced C# and Performance Depth
- Timeline: Rotate 1-week deep dives between async, jobs/burst, and profiling topics; revisit quarterly for regression sweeps.
- Resources: Unity DOTS samples, Catlike Coding optimization series, Microsoft async best practices, Unity Profiler documentation.
- Deliverables: Benchmark reports, performance budget sheet, reusable job system templates, profiling playbook.
- Tracking: Store profiling captures, benchmark scripts, and regression thresholds in repo artifacts.

## Platform-Specific Considerations
- Timeline: Kick off platform research during pre-production; allocate focused 2-week spikes before each target platform milestone.
- Resources: Official platform guidelines (Apple/Google/Sony/MS), Unity platform module docs, Oculus Dev blog, platform-specific GDC talks.
- Deliverables: Compliance checklist, build pipeline configuration files, input abstraction layer, platform risk register.
- Tracking: Maintain launch-readiness tracker with blocker status and certification evidence.

## Curated Learning Resources
- Timeline: Review/refresh list monthly; pair each milestone with at least two targeted resources.
- Resources: Unity Learn pathways, GDC Vault playlists, conference recordings, curated newsletters (Game Dev Digest), taxonomy of sample repos.
- Deliverables: Tagged resource index, annotated summaries, resource-to-skill mapping chart, backlog of content to revisit.
- Tracking: Use spaced-repetition or knowledge base tooling (Notion/Obsidian) with completion timestamps and takeaways.
