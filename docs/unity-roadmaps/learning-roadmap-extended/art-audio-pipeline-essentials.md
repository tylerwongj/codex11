# Art and Audio Pipeline Essentials

## Timeline
- Week 1: Audit current asset workflows, define naming conventions, and create import presets.
- Week 2: Implement automated checks (texture sizes, missing references) and align with collaborators.
- Week 3: Build audio routing, mixers, and test cues inside a sample scene.
- Ongoing: Schedule weekly syncs to review asset backlog and adjust guidelines.

## Suggested Resources
- Unity Manual sections on import settings, Addressables, and audio mixers.
- 80 Level and Stylized Station workflow articles for art pipeline best practices.
- FMOD or Wwise getting-started tutorials if extending beyond Unity audio.
- GDC talks on art production pipelines and sound design integration.

## Deliverables
- Pipeline handbook outlining naming, folder structure, versioning, and review gates.
- Unity preset library for textures, models, animations, and audio import settings.
- Mixer template with buses, snapshots, and example parameter controls.
- CI scripts or checklists that flag guideline violations before merge.

## Tracking & Reflection
- Maintain an asset intake log with status (requested, in-progress, approved, live).
- Track pipeline-related bugs and resolution time to measure stability.
- Run quarterly pipeline retros with collaborators to surface pain points.
- Archive before/after profiling data to validate pipeline improvements.
