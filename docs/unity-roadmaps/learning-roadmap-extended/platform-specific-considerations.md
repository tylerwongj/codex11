# Platform-Specific Considerations

## Timeline
- Pre-Production: Identify target platforms, gather certification checklists, and estimate hardware constraints.
- Mid-Production: Conduct 2-week research spikes per platform to validate build pipelines and device performance.
- Pre-Launch: Execute compliance passes, submission dry runs, and final QA sweeps.
- Post-Launch: Gather telemetry and platform feedback to inform patches.

## Suggested Resources
- Official platform documentation (Apple/Google developer portals, Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo TRC/XR checklists).
- Unity platform-specific manuals (Mobile optimization, Console build guides, XR best practices).
- Oculus, SteamVR, and XR Interaction Toolkit samples for immersive platforms.
- Talks/blogs on console certification, mobile F2P strategies, and XR comfort design.

## Deliverables
- Platform readiness matrix with requirements, owner, status, and target dates.
- Input abstraction layer or wrapper to normalize controls across devices.
- Build pipeline configuration files/scripts for each platform, including CI integration where possible.
- Risk register documenting open compliance gaps, hardware issues, and mitigation plans.

## Tracking & Reflection
- Maintain per-platform dashboards showing certification progress and outstanding blockers.
- Archive submission assets (screenshots, metadata, age ratings) for future updates.
- Record test device inventory and coverage to avoid blind spots.
- Host go/no-go reviews before each submission with action logs afterwards.
