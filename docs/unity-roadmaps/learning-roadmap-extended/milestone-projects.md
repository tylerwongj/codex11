# Milestone Projects

## Timeline
- Week 0: Define scope, success metrics, and reference inspirations.
- Weeks 1â€“3: Execute core build tasks using daily goals and mid-week check-ins.
- Week 4: Playtest, capture feedback, polish visuals/audio, and prep a short demo reel.
- Week 5: Run a structured postmortem and archive assets/systems for reuse.

## Suggested Resources
- Unity Learn microgames, Brackeys prototype playlists, and GameMaker's Toolkit breakdowns for scope guidance.
- GitHub sample projects (2D Platformer Microgame, FPS Sample) to study structure and patterns.
- Community design docs and Trello board templates for production planning.

## Deliverables
- Playable build packaged for desktop or WebGL distribution.
- Lightweight design changelog highlighting pivots and cut features.
- Postmortem document covering what worked, what failed, and next experiments.
- Reusable asset/system catalog (e.g., movement controller, inventory module).

## Tracking & Reflection
- Maintain a Kanban board with swimlanes for design, code, and content tasks.
- Capture weekly burndown snapshots and a velocity note to tune future estimates.
- Record demo videos or GIFs each Friday to visualize progress.
- Tag Git commits with milestone identifiers to make review easier later.
