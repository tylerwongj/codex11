# Game Design Fundamentals

## Timeline
- Sprint 1 (Weeks 1–2): Research loop theory and player motivation models; summarize key takeaways.
- Sprint 2 (Weeks 3–4): Apply frameworks to current milestone, draft personas, and map loops.
- Ongoing: Reserve a two-hour block weekly for playtest review and design iteration.

## Suggested Resources
- Books: "The Art of Game Design" by Jesse Schell, "Rules of Play" by Salen & Zimmerman.
- Talks: GDC sessions on progression, retention, and player psychology (e.g., Celia Hodent, Raph Koster).
- Articles/Videos: Extra Credits loops series, MDA/Bartle breakdowns, Game UX Summit recaps.
- Tools: Miro or FigJam for loop diagrams, Airtable/Sheets for balancing scenarios.

## Deliverables
- Loop diagram pack (core/secondary/meta) with annotations on player emotion targets.
- Player persona sheets referencing demographics, motivations, and UX considerations.
- Balance model spreadsheets tracking XP curves, economy sinks/sources, and difficulty ramps.
- Playtest report template capturing hypotheses, observations, and actionable follow-ups.

## Tracking & Reflection
- Maintain a versioned design journal (Notion/Obsidian) with dated entries and tags (e.g., #loops, #psychology).
- Log playtest participants, scenarios, and outcomes for continuity between sessions.
- Conduct mini-retros after each iteration to capture design debts or research needs.
- Sync design insights with engineering backlog so feature work stays aligned.
