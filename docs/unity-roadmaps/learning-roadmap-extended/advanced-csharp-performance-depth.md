# Advanced C# and Performance Depth

## Timeline
- Week 1: Review async/await patterns, convert an existing loading flow, and measure impact.
- Week 2: Prototype a Job System/Burst-enabled task, compare against baseline execution times.
- Week 3: Conduct profiling deep dive across representative scenes, documenting hotspots.
- Quarterly: Re-run benchmarks and regression tests to ensure optimizations hold.

## Suggested Resources
- Unity DOTS samples and official ECS documentation for job-oriented architectures.
- Catlike Coding tutorials on coroutines, async, and performance optimization.
- Microsoft async best practices (ConfigureAwait, exception handling) adapted for Unity contexts.
- Unity Profiler, Memory Profiler, and Frame Debugger documentation and related talks.

## Deliverables
- Async guidelines doc covering do/don'ts, exception strategy, and synchronization contexts.
- Job System template scripts and utility wrappers ready for reuse.
- Benchmark report with charts, methodology notes, and acceptance thresholds.
- Profiling playbook that lists target metrics, tool workflow, and remediation strategies.

## Tracking & Reflection
- Store benchmark projects and data files under `tests/performance/` with version tags.
- Automate performance regression checks in CI where feasible (e.g., playmode tests with profiling hooks).
- Keep a changelog of optimization experiments, results, and follow-up tasks.
- Schedule cross-discipline share-outs to propagate lessons to the broader team.
