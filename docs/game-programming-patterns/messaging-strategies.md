# Messaging Strategies
1. Build an event bus prototype using C# delegates and compare publish/subscribe flexibility.
2. Contrast with built-in C# events: encapsulation, subscription safety, multicast limitations.
3. Investigate UnityEvents: editor wiring, serialization, and runtime costs.
4. Summarize when to use each approach in a decision table (ownership, performance, tooling).
