# Data-Oriented Design and ECS
1. Read Unity DOTS documentation on Entities, Jobs, and Burst compilation.
2. Migrate a small gameplay system (e.g., projectile simulation) to ECS; measure performance.
3. Analyze memory layout benefits: cache locality, SIMD gains, and predictable updates.
4. Note pitfalls: authoring complexity, hybrid workflows, and debugging strategies.
