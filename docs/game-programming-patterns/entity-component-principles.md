# Entity-Component Principles
1. Read Chapter 7 (Component) from Robert Nystrom's *Game Programming Patterns*.
2. Compare Unity's `MonoBehaviour`-based components with pure data components.
3. Prototype a simple character using composition-only components; avoid inheritance trees.
4. Reflect on composition benefits: reuse, testability, and runtime modularity.
