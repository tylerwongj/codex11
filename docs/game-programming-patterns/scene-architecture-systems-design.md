# Scene Architecture and Systems Design
1. Audit a Unity scene for manager singletons; identify responsibilities and coupling.
2. Refactor into modular systems (e.g., `LevelLoader`, `GameStateSystem`, `UIFlowController`).
3. Use ScriptableObjects or dependency injection to share state instead of global singletons.
4. Establish lifecycle guidelines: bootstrapping, teardown, and cross-scene communication.
