# Behavioral Patterns Toolkit
1. Implement a finite state machine (FSM) for enemy AI. Track states, transitions, and entry/exit hooks.
2. Explore the Command pattern for player input buffering; log commands for undo/redo.
3. Evaluate service locator vs dependency injection: implement both for an `AudioService` and record pros/cons.
4. Document trade-offs: testing difficulty, coupling, and configuration complexity.
