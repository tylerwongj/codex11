# Physics Building Blocks

## Key Concepts
- Rigidbodies enable dynamic motion and physics simulation; use kinematic bodies for scripted motion.
- Colliders define shape; combine primitive colliders for performance, mesh colliders for exact geometry.
- Triggers detect overlaps without physical response; subscribe to `OnTriggerEnter` and related events.
- Layers and masks let you filter collisions and raycasts, enabling selective physics interactions.
- Physics materials tweak friction and bounciness to tune gameplay feel.

## Practice Checklist
- Create destructible props using compound colliders and mass distribution.
- Author trigger zones for pickups, damage volumes, and area-based AI behaviors.
- Build raycast-based interaction (e.g., grappling hook) with layer masks to exclude UI or terrain.
- Implement custom gravity or physics forces using `AddForce` and `FixedUpdate` loops.
