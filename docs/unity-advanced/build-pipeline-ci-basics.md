# Building for Platforms, Player Settings, Build Pipeline, and CI Basics
- **Player settings:** Compare quality, rendering, and platform toggles across desktop, mobile, and console. Capture recommended defaults in `config/player_settings.yaml`.
- **Automated builds:** Script builds via `UnityEditor.BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer` or the Unity CLI with `-projectPath` and `-buildTarget`. Log outputs to `logs/` for CI artifact inspection.
- **Build validation:** Implement pre-build checks for missing references, shader variant stripping, and Addressables content rebuilds.
- **CI integration:** Create a pipeline outline using GitHub Actions or Unity Cloud Build. Include steps for caching the Library folder, running `make lint`, `make test`, and headless builds.
- **Release channels:** Plan staging vs. production build profiles, and use Scripting Define Symbols to toggle features. Document release notes in `docs/changelogs`.
- **Exercises:** Configure a nightly build job that outputs platform-specific bundles and uploads them to a shared drive or artifact store.
