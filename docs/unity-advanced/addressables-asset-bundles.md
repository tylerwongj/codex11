# Addressables, Asset Bundles, and Resource Management
- **Asset labeling:** Learn how Addressables groups, labels, and addressable keys control build content and runtime queries. Practice tagging assets for DLC, platform-specific content, and localized bundles.
- **Loading workflows:** Compare `Addressables.LoadAssetAsync`, `InstantiateAsync`, and preloading via `DownloadDependenciesAsync`. Measure load times with Unity Profiler and note memory spikes.
- **Legacy vs. modern pipelines:** Review when classic AssetBundles or `Resources` are still viable and how to migrate toward Addressables for remote content delivery.
- **Caching strategies:** Configure caching behavior, versioning, and catalog updates. Simulate offline scenarios and confirm graceful fallbacks.
- **Exercises:** Build a content update testbed that swaps character skins at runtime without a full build redeploy. Automate verification by logging bundle sizes and timestamps.
