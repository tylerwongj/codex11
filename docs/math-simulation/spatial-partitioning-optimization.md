# Spatial Partitioning & Optimization
- Understand uniform grids, quadtrees, octrees, BSP trees, and bounding volume hierarchies.
- Evaluate trade-offs: memory usage, update cost, and query performance for static vs dynamic scenes.
- Implement broad-phase collision detection using spatial hashing or sweep-and-prune.
- Profile cache coherence, data-oriented layouts, and SIMD opportunities in spatial queries.
- Exercises: build a quadtree for 2D collision, compare grid vs tree partitioning under moving entities, and visualize partition structures during runtime.
- Resources: *Real-Time Collision Detection* (Christer Ericson), GDC talks on data-oriented design, and Wicked Engine dev blog deep dives.
