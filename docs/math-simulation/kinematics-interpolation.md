# Kinematics & Interpolation
- Cover linear and angular kinematics: position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk.
- Implement numerical integration schemes (Euler, semi-implicit, Runge-Kutta) and compare error characteristics.
- Learn interpolation techniques: lerp, slerp, smoothstep, smooth damp, and critically damped spring models.
- Evaluate easing curves for UI/gameplay, referencing Robert Penner's easing equations.
- Exercises: prototype a camera follow system with smooth damp, create easing curve visualizers, and tune spring parameters for snappy yet stable movement.
- Resources: Gaffer on Games articles by Glenn Fiedler, *Game Programming Gems* kinematics entries, and Catlike Coding's smoothing tutorials.
