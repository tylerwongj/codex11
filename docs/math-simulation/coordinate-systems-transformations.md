# Coordinate Systems & Transformations
- Review right-handed vs left-handed systems and the impact on cross products and rendering.
- Study homogeneous coordinates, transformation matrices, and chain composition.
- Implement world↔local space conversions, including parent-child hierarchy transforms.
- Analyze common pitfalls: precision drift, incorrect order of operations, and scale shearing.
- Exercises: build a simple transform stack, convert between engine coordinate conventions, and author gizmos that visualize basis vectors.
- Resources: *Game Engine Architecture* (Gregory) chapter on math, Unity and Unreal docs on transforms, and Jamis Buck's matrix visualization posts.
