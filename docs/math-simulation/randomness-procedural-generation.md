# Randomness & Procedural Generation
- Study pseudo-random number generators, seeds, and reproducibility strategies.
- Implement white, pink, and Perlin/Simplex noise; compare spectral properties and performance.
- Explore procedural content basics: terrain heightmaps, scatter placement, and modular assembly.
- Review sampling techniques: stratified, Poisson disk, blue noise, and their impact on visual artifacts.
- Exercises: generate noise-driven textures, create procedural level layouts, and benchmark RNG variants for bias.
- Resources: *Texturing & Modeling: A Procedural Approach*, Inigo Quilez's articles, and talks by Ken Perlin.
