# Tooling & Workflow Learning Guide

Apply these modules to streamline your Unity production workflow and keep teams aligned.

- [IDE: Visual Studio / Rider Setup, Code Analysis, Unity Integration](ide-setup-code-analysis.md)
- [Package Manager Usage, Managing Dependencies, Custom Packages](package-manager-dependencies.md)
- [Continuous Integration, Automated Builds, Crash/Analytics Instrumentation](continuous-integration-automated-builds.md)
- [Asset Pipeline Basics (Import Settings, Compression, Platform Overrides)](asset-pipeline-basics.md)

Build small automation experiments alongside each topic, then revisit the next steps checklist below to plan ongoing improvements.

## Next Steps
- Rotate through weekly "tooling mastery" sessions where team members demo new IDE features or package workflows.
- Instrument CI dashboards with trends for build duration, crash-free sessions, and asset bundle size to catch regressions early.
- Shadow an artist or technical designer to spot workflow friction and feed those insights into automation or tooling improvements.

## Key Terms
- **Tooling Session**: Scheduled time for the team to learn or demo productivity features such as IDE plugins or package workflows.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated pipelines that build, test, and report on Unity projects to catch issues early.
- **Package Manager**: Unity system that installs, updates, and versions dependencies including custom scoped registries.
- **Asset Pipeline**: Import and compression settings that control how art assets become optimized runtime data.
- **Instrumentation Dashboard**: Collection of metrics (build duration, crash-free rate) used to monitor workflow health.
- **Shadowing Exercise**: Observation session with another discipline to uncover pain points and automation opportunities.
