# Continuous Integration, Automated Builds, Crash/Analytics Instrumentation
- **CI pipeline design:** Draft workflows (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins) that run `make lint`, `make test`, and Unity batch builds on pull requests. Cache library folders and package downloads to keep runtimes fast.
- **Build automation:** Use Unity's command line (`-batchmode -nographics`) with custom build scripts (`BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer`). Script platform-specific output directories and symbol server uploads.
- **Artifact management:** Store player builds, IL2CPP symbols, and addressable catalogs as CI artifacts. Tag builds with commit hashes so QA can reproduce issues quickly.
- **Crash reporting:** Integrate Unity Cloud Diagnostics, Backtrace, or Firebase Crashlytics. Verify that symbols upload automatically so stack traces resolve on dashboards.
- **Analytics instrumentation:** Wrap analytics events in a typed service. Add unit tests that guard against schema drift (missing parameters, renamed events) before shipping releases.
- **Release gates:** Require green CI, crash-free session targets, and analytics health checks before promoting builds from staging to production.

## CI Step Outline
```yaml
- name: Run Lint
  run: make lint
```
