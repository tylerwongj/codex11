# Package Manager Usage, Managing Dependencies, Custom Packages
- **Package Manager tour:** Learn how Unity's Package Manager displays embedded, registry, and Git-based packages. Practice adding packages from the Unity Registry and removing unused dependencies.
- **Locking dependencies:** Enable version locking (`manifest.json` with `lock` section) to stabilize reproducible builds. Audit `Packages/packages-lock.json` into source control.
- **Custom package pipeline:** Scaffold a `com.example.tooling` package with its own `package.json`, editor/runtime assemblies, tests, and documentation. Reference it via a local path first, then publish to a scoped registry.
- **Third-party updates:** Create a schedule for reviewing dependency changelogs. Test upgrades in a feature branch and record migration notes under `docs/` before merging.
- **Sandboxing experiments:** Use `Packages/manifest.json` `testables` entries to load experimental packages only in test projects or editor tooling assemblies.
- **Fallback strategy:** Mirror critical packages locally or fork them in case upstream registries fail.

## Manifest Entry
```json
"com.unity.cinemachine": "2.9.7"
