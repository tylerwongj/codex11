# Team Collaboration: Scene/Prefab Merge Strategies, Task Tracking, Code Reviews
- **Source control hygiene:** Standardize Git branching (kebab-case), commit conventions, and LFS usage for large assets. Reinforce locking workflows for binary files when needed.
- **Scene and prefab merges:** Adopt Unity's Smart Merge (YAML merge) and set up `.unity`/`.prefab` reserialization to `Force Text`. Document best practices for subdividing scenes via additive loading and for breaking prefabs into smaller reusable units.
- **Task tracking:** Select a project management tool (Jira, Linear, Notion) and define ticket states. Encourage linking commits and pull requests to tasks for traceability.
- **Code reviews:** Establish checklists covering gameplay correctness, performance, test coverage, and documentation updates. Promote pair programming or mob review sessions for high-risk changes.
- **Cross-discipline workflows:** Schedule regular content syncs between designers, artists, and programmers. Document handoff expectations (e.g., scene validation passes, asset naming) in `docs/collaboration.md`.
- **Exercises:** Facilitate a mock merge conflict resolution session on a shared scene and iterate on the documented playbook based on the outcome.
- **Reference material:** Unity Smart Merge documentation; Git best practices; "Collaborating on Scenes" Unite talks.
