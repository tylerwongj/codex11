# Live Ops: Telemetry, A/B Testing, Content Updates
- **Telemetry foundations:** Identify key metrics (DAU/MAU, retention cohorts, monetization events, critical gameplay funnels). Implement a lightweight analytics wrapper that queues events, retries on failure, and batches uploads.
- **Instrumentation discipline:** Define event naming conventions, version events, and enforce schema validation. Use ScriptableObjects or configuration files to manage analytics endpoints per environment.
- **A/B and multivariate testing:** Compare service providers (Remote Config, Firebase Remote Config, custom backend). Prototype a gameplay parameter split test and ensure guardrails exist to disable experiments quickly.
- **Content delivery:** Combine Addressables, remote config, and feature flags to roll out seasonal or live events without full client updates. Document review and approval workflows.
- **Monitoring and alerting:** Establish dashboards (DataDog, Grafana, Unity Analytics) and alert thresholds. Practice incident response by simulating a misconfigured event rollout.
- **Exercises:** Run a mock live event: release a new cosmetic via Addressables, collect telemetry, split traffic between variants, and produce a retrospective report.
- **Reference material:** Unity Gaming Services docs (Analytics, Remote Config); LiveOps GDC sessions; Google Play Console experiments guide.
