# Networking Options: Netcode for GameObjects, Mirror, Photon
- **Networking models:** Survey authoritative vs. peer-to-peer architectures. Document latency budgets, rollback requirements, and input handling strategies relevant to your genre.
- **Netcode for GameObjects (NGO):** Prototype a small co-op scene using NGO. Focus on NetworkObjects, RPC types, NetworkVariable synchronization, and scene management. Capture pain points such as bandwidth usage and host migration gaps.
- **Mirror:** Explore Mirror's UNet-derived API. Compare setup effort, transport choices (Telepathy, kcp), and community ecosystem (addons like FizzySteamworks). Identify scenarios where Mirror's flexibility outweighs NGO's first-party integrations.
- **Photon Fusion / PUN:** Review Photon-hosted services, pricing tiers, and server authority models. Implement a simple matchmaking flow and note data privacy implications. Evaluate how Photon tooling fits with your deployment constraints.
- **Decision matrix:** Build a comparison table covering licensing costs, platform support, dedicated server requirements, and debugging tooling. Recommend a default networking stack for prototypes vs. production.
- **Exercises:** Create a latency simulation harness (e.g., Unity's Network Simulator) and record how each framework handles packet loss or high ping during a basic interaction test.
- **Reference material:** Official docs for NGO, Mirror, and Photon; Unity Multiplayer samples; GDC talks on netcode architecture.
