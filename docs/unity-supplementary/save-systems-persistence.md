# Save Systems and Persistence Strategies, Including Cloud Saves
- **Persistence layers:** Map local save formats (JSON, binary, ScriptableObjects, SQLite) and note when to encrypt or compress data. Document serialization libraries (e.g., Odin Serializer, Newtonsoft JSON) and choose a default approach.
- **Versioning and migrations:** Design a schema versioning strategy. Prototype a migration pipeline that upgrades old save data safely and logs failures for analysis.
- **Platform integration:** Investigate console certification rules and mobile platform storage limits. Determine where saves live on each target platform and plan fallback paths when storage is unavailable.
- **Cloud sync considerations:** Evaluate cloud providers (Unity Cloud Save, PlayFab, Firebase, custom REST). Document authentication flows, conflict resolution policies, and offline-first strategies.
- **Security and privacy:** Define data retention policies, GDPR/CCPA obligations, and sensitive data handling. Align with backend/cloud teams to ensure compliance.
- **Exercises:** Build a save/load module with checksum validation, automated regression tests, and a mocked cloud sync process that handles conflicts.
- **Reference material:** Unity Manual â€” Persistence and Serialization; PlayFab documentation; platform TRCs/TCRs for storage requirements.
