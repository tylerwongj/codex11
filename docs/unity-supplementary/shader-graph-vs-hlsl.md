# Basic Shader Knowledge: Shader Graph vs. Hand-Written, URP vs. HDRP
- **Rendering pipelines overview:** Compare the Built-in Render Pipeline with Universal (URP) and High Definition (HDRP) pipelines. Track how lighting models, post-processing, and feature availability change per pipeline and document project-specific recommendations in `docs/rendering.md`.
- **Shader Graph workflow:** Build a simple stylized material using Shader Graph. Explore subgraphs, keywords, and Custom Function nodes. Profile iteration speed improvements when artists do not rely on engineer-built shaders.
- **Hand-written shaders:** Port the Shader Graph material to an HLSL-based shader (`.shader` or `.hlsl`). Explain when hand-authored shaders are necessary (e.g., complex lighting models, dynamic branching, platform-specific optimizations) and note common pitfalls such as variant explosion.
- **URP vs. HDRP selection criteria:** Evaluate rendering requirements (target hardware, realism goals, feature needs like volumetric lighting or ray tracing). Build a table contrasting URP and HDRP for your project and capture migration considerations.
- **Exercises:** Implement the same water or foliage effect in Shader Graph and hand-written HLSL, profile on target devices, and summarize trade-offs.
- **Reference material:** Unity Manual â€” Render Pipelines; Unity Learn Shader Graph tutorials; Catlike Coding shader series for HLSL deep dives.
