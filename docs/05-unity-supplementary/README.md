# Unity Supplementary Topics Learning Guide

Use these focused modules to explore adjacent systems and live operations capabilities that complement core Unity skills.

- [Basic Shader Knowledge: Shader Graph vs. Hand-Written, URP vs. HDRP](shader-graph-vs-hlsl.md)
- [Networking Options: Netcode for GameObjects, Mirror, Photon](networking-options.md)
- [Save Systems and Persistence Strategies, Including Cloud Saves](save-systems-persistence.md)
- [Live Ops: Telemetry, A/B Testing, Content Updates](live-ops-telemetry.md)
- [Team Collaboration: Scene/Prefab Merge Strategies, Task Tracking, Code Reviews](team-collaboration-practices.md)

Tackle each topic with a prototype or case study and archive takeaways for your team.
## Suggested Learning Path
- Begin with shader fundamentals to align visual targets with technical feasibility.
- Evaluate networking stacks early to avoid costly rewrites when prototypes go multiplayer.
- Design save and cloud persistence layers alongside core gameplay loops to keep data safe.
- Layer in live ops tooling once content updates become frequent and metrics matter.
- Continuously refine collaboration practices so teams can scale without blocking each other.
