# Animation Workflows

## Key Concepts
- Animator Controllers define states and transitions; parameters (bool, float, trigger) gate movement.
- Blend trees interpolate between clips based on parameters for smooth locomotion.
- Animation events notify gameplay scripts at specific frames.
- State machine behaviors encapsulate logic tied to animation states.
- Humanoid vs generic rigs require different import settings and retargeting workflows.

## Practice Checklist
- Create an idle-walk-run blend tree controlled by character velocity.
- Use animation layers and masks for upper-body aiming while legs run.
- Trigger attack combos with animation events calling gameplay scripts.
- Profile Animator performance using the Animation window and Timeline profiler module.
