# Audio Fundamentals

## Key Concepts
- AudioSources play clips, support spatialization, Doppler effects, and 3D attenuation.
- AudioListeners (usually one per scene) capture audio for the player; position matters in 3D mixes.
- Audio Mixer groups enable volume control, effects, and snapshot transitions.
- Use Audio Mixers for ducking (sidechain) and dynamic music layers.
- AudioClip import settings affect memory usage and streaming behavior.

## Practice Checklist
- Configure spatial audio for footsteps and ambient loops with distance-based attenuation.
- Build an audio mixer with SFX, music, and dialogue groups plus snapshot transitions.
- Implement runtime volume sliders adjusting exposed mixer parameters.
- Trigger adaptive music layers in response to gameplay states (combat, exploration).
