# Input Systems

## Key Concepts
- Legacy Input Manager reads axes and buttons by string name at runtime. It is simple but inflexible.
- The new Input System package uses action maps, control schemes, and devices for better abstraction.
- Input actions can trigger callbacks (performed, canceled) and support rebinding at runtime.
- PlayerInput and InputActionAsset centralize configuration and decouple logic from hardware.

## Practice Checklist
- Configure horizontal and jump actions in both legacy and new systems, then compare code complexity.
- Swap between keyboard/mouse and gamepad profiles using control schemes without changing gameplay code.
- Implement UI navigation bindings and mobile touch controls via the new Input System.
- Profile input latency and device detection across desktop and mobile builds.
