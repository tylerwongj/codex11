# IDE: Visual Studio / Rider Setup, Code Analysis, Unity Integration
- **Environment parity:** Install the Unity Editor integration (Visual Studio Tools for Unity or Rider's Unity plugin). Verify that play mode controls, console mirroring, and shader file support work from the IDE.
- **Solution hygiene:** Regenerate `.sln` and `.csproj` files when packages change. Confirm that assembly definitions map to IDE projects so IntelliSense mirrors runtime boundaries.
- **Debugger fundamentals:** Practice attaching the debugger to a running editor and player build. Use breakpoints, conditional expressions, and watch windows to inspect MonoBehaviour state during gameplay.
- **Code quality tooling:** Enable analyzers (Roslyn, Rider inspections) alongside `dotnet format` or `csharpier` to enforce style. Configure rule severities so critical diagnostics fail builds but guidance-level tips remain informational.
- **Unity-specific productivity:** Explore Rider's Burst inspector, Visual Studio's Event Tracing for profiling, and both IDEs' gutter icons for quick scene navigation. Document hotkeys the team should share.
- **Collaboration tip:** Store IDE settings in version control via `.editorconfig` and shared settings layers so new contributors inherit the same warnings and formatting.
