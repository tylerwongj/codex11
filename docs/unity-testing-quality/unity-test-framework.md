# Unity Test Framework: Edit Mode and Play Mode Suites
- **Edit mode tests:** Execute in the lightweight NUnit runner without booting the player loop. Use them to validate pure C# logic, ScriptableObject configuration, or classes that rely on editor-only APIs. Keep fixtures fast (<100 ms) and deterministic.
- **Play mode tests:** Run inside a stripped-down player that simulates runtime execution. Target behaviours that depend on scene objects, physics steps, or coroutines. Use `UnityTest` attributes to yield across frames and run asynchronous checks.
- **Assembly definitions:** Create `Tests/EditMode` and `Tests/PlayMode` asmdefs referencing the runtime assemblies they exercise. Enable `Test Assemblies` in inspector so the Test Runner discovers the suites automatically.
- **Running suites:** Use the Unity Test Runner window for local workflows and the `-runTests` CLI flag plus an `-testResults` path for CI. Fail builds on any test failure and persist XML output for dashboards.
- **Hands-on checkpoint:** Configure a sample project where pressing `Play` loads a bootstrap scene. Author one edit mode test verifying spawn data from a ScriptableObject and one play mode test that checks a coroutine-driven state machine.
