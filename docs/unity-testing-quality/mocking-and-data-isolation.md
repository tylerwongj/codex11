# Mocking and Data Isolation for MonoBehaviours
- **Separate logic from presentation:** Move decision-making into plain C# classes (POCOs) or ScriptableObjects injected into MonoBehaviours. Test them directly without GameObject plumbing.
- **Interface-driven dependencies:** Wrap engine calls (e.g., `Physics.Raycast`, input handlers) behind interfaces and provide editor-time implementations. Substitute them in tests with frameworks such as NSubstitute, Moq, or hand-rolled fakes.
- **Scene scaffolding utilities:** Use `GameObject` factories in `[SetUp]` methods to instantiate only what a test requires. Tear them down in `[TearDown]` or rely on `UnityEngine.TestTools.TestUtils` helpers like `EnumerableExtensions.WithScene` to keep state isolated.
- **Serialized data snapshots:** Store baseline component configurations in prefab assets or ScriptableObjects. Clone them per test via `Object.Instantiate` so modifications never leak between runs.
- **Hands-on checkpoint:** Build a movement controller MonoBehaviour that depends on an `IInputSource` interface. Provide a fake implementation for edit mode tests and verify that speed capping and animation triggers respect the contract.
