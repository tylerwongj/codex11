# Debugging Tools for Runtime Inspection
- **Structured logging:** Use `Debug.Log`, `LogWarning`, and `LogError` with context objects so the console highlights offending GameObjects. Create lightweight log wrappers that gate verbose logs behind `#if UNITY_EDITOR` or a custom log level enum.
- **Visual probes:** Call `Debug.DrawLine`, `Debug.DrawRay`, or `Debug.DrawWireSphere` to visualize physics queries in the Scene view. Remember they only appear while the scene is playing or paused in the editor.
- **Gizmos:** Implement `OnDrawGizmos`/`OnDrawGizmosSelected` to render persistent cues (spawn areas, AI paths) during design time. Use color-coding and labels to distinguish states without entering Play Mode.
- **Debugger attachment:** Attach Visual Studio, Rider, or VS Code debuggers via the `Attach to Unity` command. Set breakpoints in coroutines, inspect component fields live, and evaluate expressions in the Immediate window.
- **Crash forensics:** Capture logs with the Player Log, enable stack traces for warnings, and snapshot the Profiler timeline when reproducing complex bugs. Persist artifacts alongside bug reports.
- **Hands-on checkpoint:** Create a gizmo that outlines projectile trajectories, add log wrappers that prefix messages with subsystem tags, and practice attaching a debugger to catch a failing coroutine.
