# Control Flow Essentials

## Learning objectives
- Select the right conditional construct to express branching logic clearly.
- Apply looping patterns that match the shape of your data and exit conditions.
- Leverage pattern matching and switch expressions to reduce boilerplate.

## Core ideas

### Conditionals
- Use `if`/`else if`/`else` for straightforward, readable branches.
- Reach for `switch` when comparing one value against many options or patterns.
- Guard clauses (early `return`, `throw`) keep happy-path logic more linear.

### Loops
- `for` loops shine when you know the iteration count or need the index.
- `while` and `do`-`while` focus on conditions; prefer `while` for pre-checks and `do` when the body must run once.
- `foreach` reads clearly for sequence traversal and avoids manual index management.

### Pattern matching and switch expressions
- Type patterns (`case Stream s`) and relational patterns (`case > 0`) provide expressive branching without verbose casts.
- Positional patterns and property patterns deconstruct tuples or objects inline.
- Switch expressions return a value and encourage exhaustive handling via the `_` discard.

### Jump statements
- `break` exits the nearest loop or switch; `continue` moves to the next iteration.
- `return` exits the method; `throw` signals exceptional states.
- Use jumps sparinglyâ€”too many can obscure control flow.

## Hands-on example: shipping calculation
```csharp
static decimal ShippingCost(decimal orderTotal, string destination, bool expedited) =>
    (orderTotal, destination, expedited) switch
    {
        ( <= 0m, _, _) => throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(orderTotal)),
        (var total, "US", false) when total >= 50m => 0m,
        (var total, "US", true) => Math.Max(5m, total * 0.05m),
        (_, "Canada", _) => 15m,
        (_, { Length: 2 }, _) => 25m, // ISO country code fallback
        _ => 50m
    };

foreach (var amount in new[] { 25m, 60m })
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Standard US shipping for {amount:C} = {ShippingCost(amount, "US", false):C}");
}
```

## Practice checkpoints
- Rewrite nested `if` statements as a switch expression that returns a descriptive label.
- Implement a `while` loop that reads console input until the user types `exit`, handling empty lines gracefully.
- Use property patterns to differentiate between `null`, empty, and whitespace-only strings (`string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace`).

## Further exploration
- Explore pattern matching enhancements introduced in C# 9 and later (relational, logical, and simple type patterns).
- Experiment with iterator methods (`yield return`) to build custom looping behavior.
- Analyze the generated IL for `foreach` to understand how enumerators work.
