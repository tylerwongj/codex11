# Data and Organisation Modules

Focus on these C# data handling topics to support gameplay system work.

- [Collections](collections.md)
- [Enumerations and Flags](enumerations-and-flags.md)
- [Basic Algorithms](basic-algorithms.md)
- [Serialization Basics](serialization-basics.md)

Complete them after the core foundations lessons and before tackling Unity data patterns.
