# C# Foundations Modules

Work through these topics in order to build a solid base before attempting Unity scripting.

- [Variables, Expressions, and Types](variables-expressions-types.md)
- [Control Flow](control-flow.md)
- [Methods and Parameters](methods-and-parameters.md)
- [Classes and Structs](classes-and-structs.md)
- [Properties and Initializers](properties-and-initializers.md)
- [Data and Organisation Modules](data-and-organisation/README.md)

Revisit specific modules when you hit gaps while prototyping.

## Key Terms
- **Variables & Types**: Covers value vs reference semantics, literal syntax, and type inference (`var`).
- **Control Flow**: Explains conditionals, loops, and pattern-based `switch` statements used in gameplay logic.
- **Methods & Parameters**: Shows how to encapsulate behavior, pass data with `ref`/`out`, and return results.
- **Classes vs Structs**: Highlights the differences between reference types and value types when modeling game data.
- **Properties & Initializers**: Teaches encapsulation with getters/setters plus object/collection initializer syntax.
- **Data & Organisation**: Introduces collections, enums, algorithms, and serialization needed for Unity data flows.
