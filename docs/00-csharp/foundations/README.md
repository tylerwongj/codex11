# C# Foundations Modules

Work through these topics in order to build a solid base before attempting Unity scripting.

- [Variables, Expressions, and Types](variables-expressions-types.md)
- [Control Flow](control-flow.md)
- [Methods and Parameters](methods-and-parameters.md)
- [Classes and Structs](classes-and-structs.md)
- [Properties and Initializers](properties-and-initializers.md)
- [Data and Organisation Modules](data-and-organisation/README.md)

Revisit specific modules when you hit gaps while prototyping.
