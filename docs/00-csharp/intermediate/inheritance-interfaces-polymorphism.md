# C# Inheritance, Interfaces, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes

## Why it matters
- Reuse logic by building class hierarchies; expose common contracts without locking in implementation details.
- Polymorphism lets you work with base types while deferring to overridden behavior at runtime.
- Abstract classes provide shared state + partial implementation; interfaces describe capabilities without state.

## Key syntax reminders
```csharp
class Base { public virtual void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Base"); }
class Derived : Base { public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Derived"); }

interface IFlyer { void Fly(); }
abstract class Bird : IFlyer
{
    public abstract void Fly();       // force subclasses to implement
    public virtual void Eat() { }     // optional override
}
```

## Design checkpoints
- Prefer interface-first design when you only need to promise behavior.
- Use abstract classes when you share protected helpers or default behavior.
- Mark overrides with `override`; seal behavior with `sealed override` to stop further changes.
- For base constructors: call with `: base(args)` when the parent expects parameters.
- Replace `if`/`switch` chains on type with polymorphic overrides whenever possible.

## Common patterns
- Template Method: abstract class defines `Execute()` and calls abstract steps.
- Strategy: expose interface, inject concrete implementation at runtime.
- Interface Segregation: split large interfaces into focused ones.
- Default interface members (C# 8+): add implementation without breaking consumers.

## Pitfalls to avoid
- Avoid overusing inheritance when composition works; deep hierarchies become brittle.
- Do not throw `NotImplementedException` in interfacesâ€”supply defaults or redesign.
- Remember explicit interface implementation hides members unless cast to the interface.

## Practice prompts
1. Turn a concrete class into an abstract base that enforces validation before saving.
2. Refactor a type-check `switch` into polymorphic behaviors via an interface.
3. Create two unrelated classes that share an interface and swap them behind a factory.
