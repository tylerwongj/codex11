# C# Intermediate Topics

Use these modules to round out language knowledge once the foundations feel comfortable.

- [Generics](generics.md)
- [Inheritance, Interfaces, and Polymorphism](inheritance-interfaces-polymorphism.md)
- [Delegates, Events, and Lambdas](delegates-events-lambdas.md)
- [Error Handling](error-handling.md)
- [Memory Management](memory-management.md)

Return to specific topics when you start building reusable Unity systems.

## Key Terms
- **Generics**: Language feature for type-safe reuse and collections without casting.
- **Polymorphism**: Concept allowing derived types to override behavior defined by base classes or interfaces.
- **Delegates & Events**: Abstractions for passing methods and implementing publisher/subscriber patterns.
- **Exception Handling**: Strategies for catching, wrapping, and propagating runtime errors.
- **Memory Management**: Understanding GC, `IDisposable`, and struct vs class trade-offs.
