# Version Control Workflows for Unity Projects
- **Project serialization settings:** Enable `Force Text` and `Visible Meta Files` under Project Settings â†’ Editor. This keeps `.unity` and `.prefab` assets diffable and ensures `.meta` GUIDs stay in version control.
- **Unity-aware `.gitignore`:** Ignore `Library/`, `Temp/`, `Logs/`, `Build/`, and auto-generated IDE folders while keeping `.meta` files tracked. Store the template under `config/gitignore.unity` if you need variants per platform.
- **Branch hygiene:** Use short-lived feature branches (kebab-case) and pull base changes before pushing. Gate merges on `make lint`, `make test`, and a play mode smoke test.
- **Smart merging:** Configure `UnityYAMLMerge` (Smart Merge) as the `merge.tool` so multi-user scene or prefab edits reconcile automatically. Fall back to manual conflict resolution only when semantic intent diverges.
- **Large assets:** Track audio, textures, or meshes over 10 MB with Git LFS. Document asset origins and licenses in `assets/README.md` entries.
- **Hands-on checkpoint:** Initialize a fresh repository, apply the Unity `.gitignore`, commit with meta files included, and test a Smart Merge conflict by editing the same prefab on two branches.

## Git LFS Command
```bash
git lfs track "Assets/Art/**"
```

## Key Terms
- **Force Text Serialization**: Project setting that stores scenes and prefabs as YAML so Git can diff and merge them.
- **Meta File**: Sidecar asset generated by Unity that preserves GUIDs; keeping them in source control prevents reference breakage.
- **Unity .gitignore**: Ignore template tailored to Unity that excludes cache folders like `Library/` while tracking `.meta` files.
- **UnityYAMLMerge (Smart Merge)**: Merge driver that understands Unity YAML and reduces conflicts when multiple users edit scenes.
- **Git LFS**: Large File Storage extension used to version heavy binaries like textures, meshes, or audio clips.
- **Feature Branch Workflow**: Short-lived branch strategy where developers rebase often, run lint/tests, and require reviews before merging.
- **Smoke Test**: Minimal play mode run that validates the project still boots after integrating version-controlled changes.
